Python on the Fly - a non framework web development platform




## Flyton 

Non framework development environment

Based on python3

Generate html pages on the fly , just like old php , meaning the html/css/js pages generated in real time server side

Need to make an animation of a terminal showing python code printing html page , and seeing in the animation it’s result on a browser

Programing in python , well knows and here to stay prog-language 

Using the f-string of the python to inject variables , to be used as a nice web pages generator , look like Components without the framework

Using a set of few programming methodology - so the code will be self explainable

A web cgi script will handle the connection from the browser to the Linux server

Linux , ubuntu , with apache2

Optionally , AWS with CloudFront for https secure connection , or a load balancer

Recommended database , mysql. 

A set of tools automatically manage a lot of the basic actions

Session management , browser + server

Best practice sql records format

One place of accessing the database

Directory structure : server, client, admin

Support multi app on the same server

Ready a set of html elements for simple handle of web actions:
-Button
-Card area
-Link
-Page routing handle


Recommended working with Bootstrap in case you don’t have a stric design ready from a Ux/Ui provider

Client - server api , 100% managed by the tools , with functions for Javascript on the browser and python code on the server

Simple pages mode - for a pages which are just fix content - so no need for developing it inside the environment in python

Write simple code methodology

Make sure one return to the code generated in the past - will be fast and simple to read and rewrite

Try to be 0 packages install in the python level , so no packages expiration required

The Flyton utility promised to be 100% backward compatible for future stability
